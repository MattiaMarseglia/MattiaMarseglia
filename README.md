# Hi There!
I am Mattia Marseglia, a passionate AI Engineer. I just obtained a Master's Degree in AI Computer Engineering at UniversitÃ  degli studi di Salerno.  

As someone who pays close attention to detail and is fully invested in my work, I am eager to use my passion for Artificial intelligence to drive technological advancement and make a real impact on the world through innovative ideas. 

### ðŸŽ“ Academic backgroud
**Master's Degree in AI Computer Engineering** â€“ UniversitÃ  degli studi di Salerno (Italy)
* GPA: â€‹29.12/30 (3.88/4)
* 110/110 summa cum laude
* MSc thesis "Multi-task techniques for road weather classification and surface anomaly detection", The addressed problem concerns the classification of road conditions, with three main sub-tasks: detecting irregularities, assessing friction, and identifying the material of the road surface. The proposal involved the research and subsequent reorganization of a highly significant dataset in the state of the art and the implementation of a complex architecture based on CNN, RNN, introducing an innovative algorithm called PLA.

**Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering** â€” UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Salerno (Salerno, Italy) 
* GPA: 28.87/30 (3.85/4)
* 110/110 summa cum Laude
* Graduated in the earliest possible session, with full marks
* BSc thesis "Progettazione e realizzazione di un portale web per il conteggio automatico dei volti".
